# NYC Taxi Data Analysis with BigQuery

### Project for Cloud Computing Course of MSc in Data Science for Management (UniCT)

The project was carried out exploiting **Google Cloud Platform**.

The aim was to make a data analysis on the *New York City Taxi* public dataset — available on the Marketplace of Google Cloud Platform — using BigQuery, and then to build a machine learning model using BigQuery ML.

The task for the machine learning model consisted in a regression problem: the goal was to predict the taxi "fare amount" of a ride, given features such as pick-up and drop-off locations, ride distance, day of week and pick-up hour.
